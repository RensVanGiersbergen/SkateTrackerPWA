# Color research
This document is focussed on researching the different impacts on the user according to the primary color used in the design.

## Main Question
What primary color is best for my design?

### What feeling SkateTracker must deliver to it's users
Since SkateTracker is a tool used by skaters who go out to enjoy their rides it should give them a relaxed feeling to enjoy the most of their rides.
It should also give them courage to explore new area's and keep on going. Next up I want it to feel adventurous going for a ride.
So they need to be relaxed, encouraged and feel adventurous.

### Moods by colors
I've look at this study by _Mountain Vista Psychology_ about what moods peole get by different colors. Thanks to this I could come up with my conclusion

## Conclusion
I concluded to go with a orange primary color. This would give people feelings of success, confidence, bravery and sociability. Sociability is less important.
The bravery and confidence would encourage the user which is very important as mentioned earlier and with confidence it's easier to relax since you know everything will be alright.
The bravery and confidence will allow the user to be more adventurous. So orange is the color most suitable as primary color.
